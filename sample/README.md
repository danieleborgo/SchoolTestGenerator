# Samples

This folder provides an example that shows all the features available
in this software. It can be generated by running this in the root:

    python main.py sample/test.json -s sample/students.json

The output is made by the PDF file, representing the real test, and by a
JSON file containing the the test logger with the used random values.

For executing the program for anonymous users, this can be used:

    python main.py sample/test.json -a sample/anonymous_users.json

This is what the program writes when _-h_ is passed as argument:
    
    usage: main.py [-h] [-s STUDENTS_PATH | -a USERS_PATH] test_path
    
    This program generates school tests
    
    positional arguments:
      test_path             The path of the JSON test file
    
    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -s STUDENTS_PATH, --students STUDENTS_PATH
                            Add the path of named students JSON file
      -a USERS_PATH, --anonymous USERS_PATH
                            Add the path of anonymous students JSON file

Besides these there are also the two generated logger, distinguishable
by the ending character.
